[   1] [Images]
  Drag and drop input files or folders here and click Apply filters to the file list
  Suggest dragging files not folders

[   2] [Metadata]
  This step captures the experiment name and well number from each image.
  ***On each run, click Update to verify that the experiment and well # are identified correctly.***

[   3] [NamesAndTypes]
  This step organizes the different channel images from each field.
  ***On each run, click Update to verify the images are identified correctly.***

[   4] [Groups]
  This pipeline has no groups.

[   5] [IdentifyPrimaryObjects]
  Identify nuclei from the DAPI channel.

[   6] [IdentifySecondaryObjects]
  Identify cells using phalloidin (red) channel

[   7] [IdentifyTertiaryObjects]
  Identify cytoplasm by subtracting the nucleus from the cell

[   8] [ExpandOrShrinkObjects]
  Create a nuclear ring, step 1: Shrink the detected nuclei

[   9] [ExpandOrShrinkObjects]
  Create a nuclear ring, step 2: Expand the detected nuclei

[  10] [IdentifyTertiaryObjects]
  Create a nuclear ring, step 3: Subtract the shrunken area from the original area

[  11] [MeasureObjectIntensity]
  Measure intensity of target (green) channel in each object type

[  12] [ExportToSpreadsheet]
  Export results

[  13] [GrayToColor]
  Create an overlay image on the green channel, without rescaling the intensity

[  14] [OverlayOutlines]
  Overlay the cell and nuclei outlines on the overlay image

[  15] [SaveImages]
  Save the overlay image for evaluating the detection of cells
  *** The base image folder at the bottom should be the folder containing the INPUT images!
  It will be used to reproduce the folder structure in the output folder.
